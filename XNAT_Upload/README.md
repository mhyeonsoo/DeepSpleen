# Directory for XNAT data storage

This is an optional process for data storage on the server.
Since this project used to upload data on the XNAT to distribute and store dataset,
this function was added.

### send_disk.sh
Bash script for data uploading.
Includes editting comment on dicom header file, and store function for dicom push.

### comments.py
Editting comment on the specific header, 'Patient Comments'
Since the XNAT server automatically designate file's project directory, subjects, and session, 
those information should be added in advance.

### storescu.py
Data push function from pynetdicom package.
Using server information and user identification, dataset would be uploaded on the XNAT.
